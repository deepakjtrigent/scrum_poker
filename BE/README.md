## Building Scrum Poker with WebSockets for Instant Data Updates - Backend

This project focuses on creating a Scrum Poker web application using Angular as the frontend framework and WebSockets for real-time communication between the client and the server. Scrum Poker, also known as "Planning Poker," is an Agile planning and estimating technique used to determine the time and effort required to complete user stories within a sprint. Participants use cards resembling playing cards to indicate their estimates.
